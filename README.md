# Code Challenges

This repository contains code challenges that I use to practice and stay active and up-to-date, mainly .NET and SQL. These challenges are taken from sources such as Hacker Rank, LeetCode and other platforms. These challenges are meant to help me improve my coding skills and learn new techniques and best practices. They cover a wide range of topics, from basic algorithms to more advanced topics such as optimization. 

The solutions provided here are my own personal take on the challenges and are not necessarily the only or the best way to solve them. Feel free to use this repository as a resource for your own learning and practice.
